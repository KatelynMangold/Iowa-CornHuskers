<h2><u>Game Recap</u></h2>
<p>The Cornhuskers started off their 2018 campaign with a resounding win against the Orange-Peelers.<br>
From the first kickoff, the Cornhuskers completely dominated the game in all facets. QB Ball Thrower<br> 
was spectacular, going 27/29 for 674 yards and 9 touchdowns in the first quarter! WR Speedy McNeil was<br> 
also in his bag, with an astounding 6 receptions for 315 yards and 3 punt return touchdowns. Hard Head<br>
 Sr. wrecked havoc on the opposing D-Line per usual with 8 sacks and 1 fumble forced. However, <br>
 the Cornhuskers received a huge blow to their #1 ranked defense, losing stud DB Chris DaBlack for<br> 
 the season in the 2nd quarter. Look for Sam Adeniy to step up and fill the void DaBlack leaves. </p>
 
 <h2><u>Next Game</u></h2>
 <p>The Cornhuskers play the Taxi - Drivers, a perennial bottom feeder in the EBG conference. Expect OC Puff to run up the score once again.</p>
