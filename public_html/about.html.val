[CSE] Message number 1:
This document's title is 16 characters long. Consider adding
a <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="(13
character short title)"> tag to the head section. This
shorter title will be used when an iOS user adds the page to
their Home Screen, otherwise the page title will be used and
will be chopped off after the 13th character. The title is:
"Iowa Cornhuskers".

[CSE] Message number 2 in line 1:2:
An HTML5 DOCTYPE was found. HTML5 (sometimes called just
HTML) is in a constant state of flux. While many parts of
HTML5 are considered stable and safe to use, there are parts
that are not stable or that may not be well supported by
browsers. When using HTML5, be sure to understand the
potential problems when using parts and features that may
not be stable (and thus may change in the future) or that
may not be widely supported. Visit
https://www.htmlvalidator.com/help.php?m=3&h=safetouse for
information about what is safe to use.

[CSE] Message number 3 in line 8:6:
Tip - A good title is important for search engine listings.
Try to use keywords and search terms in the title but keep
it readable and not too long. Don't just stuff keywords in
the title. The first words in the title are more likely to
result in higher rankings than subsequent words, so use
important keywords at the very beginning when reasonable.
The title should also be something that a user will want to
click on when it's listed on a search results page. A good
title is also important when a visitor bookmarks a page.
Example: <title>Download CSE HTML Validator - Powerful HTML
and Link Checking Software for Windows</title>. We recommend
that the "title" tag be one of the first tags inside the
"head" section (but after any meta charset or viewport
tags).

[CSE] Message number 4 in line 8:12:
This document's title contains only 2 words. It may be
inadequate for search engine purposes. A good title is
important to your search engine rankings and listings.
Optimal page title length is 5-15 words and no more than 60
characters (Google typically displays the first 50-60
characters but it's a good idea to keep titles under 55
characters so they display properly most of the time). The
title should contain relevant and descriptive phrases and/or
relevant keywords and search terms while also remaining
human-readable. If possible, use important keywords at the
very beginning of the title.

It is recommended that the "height" and "width" attributes
be used with the "img" element so browsers can leave the
correct amount of space for them while downloading the image
(which can take more time on mobile networks and devices).
This will also prevent issues and annoyances due to reflow
when the image becomes available or if image downloading is
disabled. This message is displayed up to 5 times.

[CSE] Message number 8 in line 16:2:
[7] Ensure that the "img" element is rarely, if ever, used
as a layout tool. Always use CSS for layout and positioning.
For example, do not use "img" elements to display
transparent images which rarely convey meaning and rarely
add anything useful to the document. This message is
displayed only once.

[7] The "u" element is often rendered with an underline.
Therefore, it is recommended that "u" be avoided where it
could be confused for a hyperlink. This message is displayed

  28: <h2><u>Follow Us</u></h2>

[CSE] Message number 15 in line 28:6:
Ensure that the "u" element is used appropriately. In most
cases, another element is more appropriate than the "u"
element. For example, use "em" for stress emphasis, "b" or
"mark" for key words or phrases (depending on the context),
"strong" for importance, "cite" for marking book titles (or
other titles), and "i" for an alternate voice or mood. If
only underlined text is desired, then use CSS
(text-decoration: underline). Use the "u" element for
semantic reasons, like representing text with an
unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual
annotation, such as labeling the text as being misspelt.
This message is displayed only once.

Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[CSE] Comment number 7:
Editing Tip: This document was specified as utf-8 encoded.
Editing documents with the wrong encoding may cause document
corruption. Ensure that any editor used to edit a document
properly supports the document's encoding and properly loads
it with the correct encoding. CSE HTML Validator's editor
supports UTF-8 and other common encodings.

[CSE] Comment number 8:
Use CSS class names that describe the nature of the content
instead of names that describe the presentation of the
content. For example, don't use class="red" or class="bold",
instead use something like class="important".

[CSE] Comment number 9:
[133] Mobility Tip #21 - Layout the page so that page
scrolling is limited to one direction. If an object causes
scrolling in another direction, then it should not cause the
remainder of the page to also require scrolling in that
other direction.

[CSE] Comment number 10:
<meta name="description" content="(actual description)">
should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief
description of what is contained on this page. Although
descriptions may not be used directly for rankings, search
engines may display descriptions in search results, with
bolding of the relevent keywords. Therefore, a good
description can help boost click-through rates and thus
increase traffic to a website. If you're using HTML
Validator's integrated editor, then this can be added from
the 'Tags' menu or from the HTML Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 11:
Number of "a" links: 6, of which 0 (0.0%) have
rel="nofollow". Use rel="nofollow" to tell search engines
not to follow the link and tell Google not to transfer
PageRank or anchor text across the link. Use rel="nofollow"
for untrusted content, paid links, and crawl prioritization.
Visit https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569 for
more information.

[CSE] Comment number 12:
No italicizing, emphasizing, bolding, or strong tags were
used. Emphasizing or italicizing keywords (with the "em"
element) may improve rankings. Similarly, using strong text
or bolding keywords (with the "strong" element) may also
improve rankings.

[113] Random Search Engine Tip #18 - USE YOUR SERVER LOG.
Look at your site's referral logs to see what keywords
people are using to find your site. Use this information to
